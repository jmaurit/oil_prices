Dear Prof. Smith, 

Thank you for the thoughtful and thorough review of my paper, EJ 14-131, "The Effect of Oil Price on Field Production: Evidence from the Norwegian Continental Shelf."

I have carefully read through the reports from the three referees as well as your own comments.  I recognize that the referees concerns are substantial.  At the same time, I believe I can adequately addresse most of their concerns through both a better and clearer explanation of the methodology, as well as with reformulations and extensions of the existing analysis.  In other words, I would like to attempt a revision and resubmission.

As you and the referees note, I will need to substantially shorten the paper.  This will of course require trade-offs, especially when I also need to expand the analysis at certain parts.  What is the Energy Journal´s policy, if any, on online appendices?  In particular I plan on using Monte Carlo simulations to addresse some of the referees´ concerns.  The details of the simulations could then be placed in an online appendix, with the main results referred to in the main text.  

Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Best wishes

Johannes Mauritzen
